# HAT-MOUSE
This is basically an air mouse that I will mount on the brim ofa ball cap, so that I can move the mouse pointer by tilting my head. I will also clip buttons on bendable leads from the brim of the cap, Down to each side of my face so that I can activate either one by pushing out my left or right cheek with my tounge.
The BOM page provides Amazon links for enough parts to hopefully build five unit,three using Esp-32 MPUs and two using RP2040s. The reason for this is I am concerned that I may run into difficulties programming the drag and drop function and might have to use the RP 2040 over USB for the buttons and the ESP 32 over Bluetooth for the pointer movement.  

PS; sorry for any typos this is extremely hard using voice control which I am forced to use until I manage to build this Device!
